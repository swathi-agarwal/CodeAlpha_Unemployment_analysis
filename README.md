# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze unemployment rates using Python, providing insights into trends and patterns over time. The dataset includes unemployment data up to November 2020, and various visualizations and statistical methods are used to interpret the results. The objective is to understand the economic impact of unemployment and identify key periods of fluctuation, such as during financial crises or the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Introduction
